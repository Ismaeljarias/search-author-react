## What I used?

##### For the Style and UI I used [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) I like this library because help me to style components quick and the plus is the performance since create a style and dynamic css class so we don't have any style loaded in the html

##### React Stuff with Typescript, I focus on the core used of react, using hooks help me to control the data and what to display and hide. Typescript help to control the props of the components and of course the autocomplete of the properties that comes from the request

##### Vanilla JS, mainly promises for fetch the data using axios to better control the data
